# Ammocan

This addon modifies supported vehicles to use ammocan objects that can be loaded into a vehicle inventory. Players are able to manipulate these ammocans directly so extra ammocans can be added to the vehicle in the field. This also allows you to load more ammo than vehicles carry by default.
